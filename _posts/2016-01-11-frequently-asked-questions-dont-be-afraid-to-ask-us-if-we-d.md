# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

## DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK US IF WE DON'T ANSWER IT HERE! 

## ARE YOU TRUSTWORTHY? 
> 
> We have been covering weddings for over 5 years and have never missed one or had any complaints. We are trusted to perform by clients such as Manchester United, Goldman Sachs, Manchester Metropolitan University and local councils. We have been recommended by lots of our brides to their bridesmaids. Read our reviews on the website or Facebook, for more reassurance. 

## ARE YOU INSURED? 
> 
> We have a policy that covers us for up to Â£5million   

## WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ARE SICK / INJURED ETC? 
> 
> We have 3 photographers to cover your day so we have never missed one so far! 

## HOW DO I BOOK? 
> 
> Click on here to send us an enquiry and we will get in touch and send you over our electronic contract, Once that is signed by us and you, and we have received the deposit, you booked in! 

## HOW DO I PAY?

> We recommend bank transfer is best, as it gives you peace of mind that we have received payment. We require all weddings to be paid within the month opt the wedding, unless we have agreed something else special for you.  

## WILL YOU COVER OUR AREA? 
> 
> Yes! We will travel to your wedding, so far we've not refused a wedding based on distance!

## I'M THINKING OF AN ALBUM BUT NOT SURE 
> 
> It's perfectly fine, the price you see on the website is the price you will pay if you decide to upgrade your package at a later date. The only exception is if you want to have extra pages or copies etc.  

## HOW WILL YOU MAKE THE ALBUM IF YOU ARE FAR AWAY FROM ME? 
> 
> We make the album and share it online with you. You have a copy of all the pictures we have so we can work together to make sure the album is exactly how you want it to be, before we go to print 

## CAN WE MEET UP BEFORE THE WEDDING? 
> 
> As we travel all over the country, its rare that we get to meet up before e the big day. Many people worry that this may be a disadvantage, and we can assure its not! We are experts of adapting to the day and going with the flow! Imaging having your plans ruined because of weather and your photographer not being able to adapt! We have to be adaptable and flexible to your day! 

## ARE YOU GOOD WITH KIDS AS THERE WILL BE A LOT AT THE WEDDING? 
> 
> We also photograph a lot of nurseries, so kids - we love em! 

## MY PARTNER HATES THE CAMERA - WHAT CAN YOU DO!

> So do we - thats why we are photographers!!! We understand that not everyone is a selfie junkie, so we work with you to make you feel relaxed and enjoy the day. Many people have commented that they were dreading the photography sessions but enjoyed loving it and we made their day!
